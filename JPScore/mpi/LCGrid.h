 * \section Description
 * This class implements the Linked-Cells algorithm
 * \ref{cacs.usc.edu/education/cs596/01-1LinkedListCell.pdf}
 * A grid is laid on the complete geometry and the pedestrians are assigned the cells
 * at each simulation step. Only pedestrians in the neighbouring cells are involved
 * in the force computations.
 * The class is static as only one instance is needed per simulation round.
 * This solution is fine for parallelisation as well, at least for OpenMP.
