`JuPedSim` offers also up to date Docker images. 
Basically, we package `JuPedSim` and all its dependencies in a lightweight image, which can just be used without any *hassle*. 

For these who wonder what the Docker is, here is what Docker.io says:

> Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers 
> from any application. 
> The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, 
> on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.


## Linux

For Linux systems please check this excellent blog: 
[Running GUI apps with Docker](http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2014/09/11/running-gui-apps-with-docker/)

## Mac OSX

start `socat` to expose local xquartz socket on a TCP port:

    socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:\"$DISPLAY\"

Then in a new window pass the `DISPLAY` with your own IP-address to the container by running

    docker run -it -e DISPLAY=YOUR_IP:0 -v /some/host/folder/:/tmp jupedsim/jupedsim

See also this [issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8710)

This will mount `/some/host/folder` in docker's `/tmp`, which is useful to exchange data between your machine and the docker container.

There seems to be an issue after updating XQuartz: `libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast `

Downgrading to 2.7.8 solves the problem. 

 Note: You can get you IP by typing in the terminal `ifconfig`.

## Windows

Works only with Windows 10.

@todo: How? need someone with a windows machine to check this.
