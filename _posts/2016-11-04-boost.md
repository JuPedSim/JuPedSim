One of  `JuPedSim`'s [requirements](2016-11-03-Requirements.html) is Boost. 

In order to make sure that this library is properly installed,  this *minimal working* example can be very handy.

```c++
#include <boost/geometry.hpp>
#include <boost/geometry/geometries/point_xy.hpp>
#include <boost/geometry/geometries/polygon.hpp>
#include <iostream>

using namespace boost::geometry;


int main()
{
  std::cout << "Using Boost "
          << BOOST_VERSION / 100000     << "."  // major version
          << BOOST_VERSION / 100 % 1000 << "."  // minor version
          << BOOST_VERSION % 100                // patch level
          << std::endl;
}
```

Using the following [CMakeLists.txt](https://cst.version.fz-juelich.de/jupedsim/jpscore/snippets/3) 
the compilation of the aforementioned file goes like

```bash
cmake .
make
run ./main
```

It is also possible to compile the code directly without passing by `CMake`, however since it is used with `JuPedSim`, it is a 
good idea to test it here too.
