The Jülich Pedestrian Simulator ([JuPedSim](http://www.jupedsim.org)) consists of four modules which are loosely
coupled and can be used independently at the moment. These are:

1. `jpscore`: the core module computing the trajectories. See [list](http://jupedsim.github.io/jpscore/models/operativ) of implemented models.
2. `jpsreport`: a tool for analyzing the trajectories and validating the
model. It implements a couple of measurement methods including the [Voronoi-method](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2009.12.015) for calculating the density.
3. `jpsvis`: a tool for visualizing the input (geometry) and output (trajectories) data.
4.  `jpseditor`: a tool for creating and editing geometry files with dxf import/export capabilities.


## Quick Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JuPedSim/JuPedSim.git
cd JuPedSim
git submodule update --init --recursive
make -f Makefile.cmake check
```

Note: it is very important to update the submodule, otherwise the they will be empty!


`CMake` will eventually report any missing packages. Please fix these errors/warnings first **before** proceeding with the compilation of `JuPedSim` with 

```shell
make -f Makefile.cmake check release
```


## Showcase and tutorials

To highlight some features of `JuPedSim` we have uploaded some videos and tutorials on
