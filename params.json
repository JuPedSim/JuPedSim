These are:\r\n\r\n1. `JPScore`: the core module computing the trajectories. At the moment a modification of the [Generalized Centrifugal Force Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4297) is implemented. Another (yet unpublished) model is implemented.\r\n2. `JPSvis`: a tool for visualising the input (geometry) and output (trajectories) data.\r\n3. `JPSreport`: a tool for analysing the trajectories and validating the\r\nmodel. It implements a couple of measurement methods including the [Voronoi-method](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2009.12.015) for calculating the density.\r\n4.  `JPSeditor`: a tool for creating and editing geometry files with dxf import/export capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe code is *actively developed* in a [GitLab repository](https://cst.version.fz-juelich.de/public/projects). Please consider cloning the code there.  To be **notified** about releases and updates please follow us [@JuPedSim](https://twitter.com/JuPedSim).\r\n\r\n*JuPedSim is at the moment validated using the [RiMEA Testcases](http://www.rimea.de) Also it is stillundergoing an extensive unit-testing. Validation of the implemented models with respect to experimental data is planned, but only partially implemented.*\r\n\r\n### Showcase\r\n\r\nTo highlight some features of `JuPedSim` we have uploaded  some videos on\r\nour [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuPedSim).\r\n\r\n### Building from sources\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone git@github.com:JuPedSim/JuPedSim.git\r\ncd JuPedSim\r\ngit submodule update --init\r\nmake -f Makefile.cmake\r\n```\r\nThe release binaries will be located in the bin folder.\r\n\r\n### Frequently Asked Questions\r\n-------------------------------\r\n1. What is the official page of `JuPedSim`?\r\n  * www.jupedsim.org and the contact is `info at jupedsim.org`. You will find more information on the working group and other tools and experimental pedestrians data we have been collecting over the years.\r\n\r\n2. Where is the official repository ?\r\n * `JuPedSim` is developed at the [Forschungszentrum Jülich](http://www.fz-juelich.de) in Germany and the bleeding edge code is in their intern git [repository](http://cst.version.fz-juelich.de). At the moment only specific tags are pushed to GitHub.\r\n\r\n3. Is there a manual ?\r\n * Of course, the user's guide is found in the downloaded archive.\r\n\r\n4. Are the models validated ?\r\n * At the moment with the validation scenarios from [RiMEA](http://www.rimea.de)\r\n * We are actually setting up verification and validation tests. Some verification tests are included in this version but most of them will be available with the next version.\r\n\r\n5. How can I contribute to `JuPedSim`?\r\n * Testing and reporting bugs will be great. If you want to contribute actively to the code, by implementing new models and/or features, you are welcome to do so. Please contact uns per mail at\r\n `info at jupedsim.org` so that we can grant you access to the repositories.\r\n\r\n6. And the License?\r\n  * JuPedSim itself is released under LGPL and the included librairies under their respective licenses of course.\r\n","google":"UA-8457685-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
